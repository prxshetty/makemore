# Make More: Character-Level Language Model

## Overview

This project implements a character-level language model from scratch, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's neural network video series. The model generates new text by predicting the next character in a sequence.

## Features

- Character-level tokenization
- Bigram language model
- Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model
- Training and sampling functionality

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy

## Acknowledgements

This project is based on Andrej Karpathy's "makemore" series of neural network videos.
